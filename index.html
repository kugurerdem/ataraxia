    <h1>Wisdom</h1>

    <p>
    This page is where I keep a list of quotes that I find inspiring for a good
    living. I intend to use this page as a way to recommend these quotes to
    others as well as a reminder to myself. I hope you find them as inspiring
    as I do.
    </p>

    <p>
    I have also created a <a href="game.html" target="_blank">simple game</a>
    where a philosopher pratagonist, Ufuk, embarks on a quest to reach my
    favorite pieces of advice. Ufuk must pass trials which involve defeating
    certain monsters.
