        <h1>Wisdom</h1>

        <p>
        This page is where I keep a list of quotes that I find inspiring for a good
        living. I intend to use this page as a way to recommend these quotes to
        others as well as a reminder to myself. I hope you find them as inspiring
        as I do.
        </p>

        <p>
        I have also created a <a href="game/index.html" target="_blank">simple game</a>
        for recreational purposes. In the game, a philosopher pratagonist, Ufuk,
        embarks on a quest of defeating certaing monsters for the purpose of
        unlocking my scrolls of wisdom.
