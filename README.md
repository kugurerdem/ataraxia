# Ataraxia

You can play the game from
[here](https://kugurerdem.github.io/ataraxia/)

Ataraxia is a recreational game that I have chose to create on my spare time,
only using plain JavaScript.

You play as a philosopher named Ufuk, on a quest for wisdom, facing challenges
in my trials. After each trial, I share one of my favorite pieces of advice.

# Assets

I did not create the assets used in this repository. The primary set of assets
can be found in the "Mystic Woods"

open for non-commercial use.
