# JavaScript Playground Game

The primary objective of this repository is to embark on a recreational journey
to explore and learn more about game development, particularly to delve into
the inner workings of HTML Canvas. With no predefined plan or roadmap, the
development process will unfold organically as random ideas come to my mind.
